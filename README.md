# Marsh Brids

What is the relationship between high- elevation plasticity and adaptation? How do these phenomena interact and feed into one another? Here we compare blood and morphological characters among and between two species pairs, one with continuous elevational distribtuions and one with disjunct extreme high- and low-elevation distributions. *Troglodytes aedon* & *Zonotrichia capensis* both inhabit continuous elevational distributions of >3000 m on the west slope of the Peruvin Andes. While *Tachuris rubrigastra* and *Phleocrypyes melanops* both inhabit highly disjunct coastal low-elevation (<100 m a.s.l) and Andean high-elevation marshes (>3500 m a.s.l).

We are using blood and morhological characters specimens collected by <a href="http://www.msb.unm.edu/" target="_blank">The Museum of Southwestern Biology</a> to compare blood repsonses to elevation among and between species that experince little to no gene flow across elevation (generalists) and those that are pustaively isolated (disjunct specialist populations).
