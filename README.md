# Marsh Birds

What is the relationship between high- elevation plasticity and adaptation? How do these phenomena interact and feed into one another? Here we compare blood and morphological characters among and between two species pairs, one with continuous elevational distributions and one with disjunct extreme high- and low-elevation distributions. *Troglodytes aedon* & *Zonotrichia capensis* both inhabit continuous elevational distributions of >3000 m on the west slope of the Peruvian Andes. While *Tachuris rubrigastra* and *Phleocrypyes melanops* both inhabit highly disjunct coastal low-elevation (<100 m a.s.l) and Andean high-elevation marshes (>3500 m a.s.l).

We are utilizing blood and morphological characters of these species pairs collected by <a href="http://www.msb.unm.edu/" target="_blank">The Museum of Southwestern Biology</a> model blood characters (hemoglobin, Hct, MCH, MCV, MCHC, TRBC) and morphological features (heart, pectoralis major, and supracoracoideus) as functions of elevation, latitude, species and phylogeny.
